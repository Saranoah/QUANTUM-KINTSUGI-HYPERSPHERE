### **Step 2: Cracked Visual Effects**
Use this **ASCII art divider** between sections:
```markdown
<!-- GOLDEN CRACK DIVIDER -->
[//]: # (══════════════►◄══════════════)
```
*(Paste this between sections—it will appear as a broken line)*

---

### **Step 3: Gold Text Effects**
```markdown
## <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d4af37y.png" width="20"> **Features**  
`#️⃣` **Golden Errors** → `Segmentation fault` becomes `Kintsugi fracture`  
`#️⃣` **Quantum Haiku** → All code follows 5-7-5 syllable structure  

## <img src="https://i.imgur.com/d4af37y.png" width="20"> **Quick Start**  
```bash
# Clone with existential uncertainty
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quantum-Kintsugi-Hypersphere
cd Quantum-Kintsugi-Hypersphere && ls -la
```

### **Step 4: Add Golden Shields (Badges)**
Paste these under your header:
```markdown
[![License: AGPL-3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GOLD-FFD700)](https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0)  
[![Kintsugi Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cracks%20Repaired-97%25-FFAA00)](https://github.com/your-username)  
[![Quantum Poetry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Haiku%20Compliance-5%2F7%2F5-00FFD4)](https://github.com/your-username)  
```

*(Customize links by replacing `your-username`)*

### **Step 5: Commit & Showcase**
1. Click **"Commit changes"**  
2. Your README will now look like this:
