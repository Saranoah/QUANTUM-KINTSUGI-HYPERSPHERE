A ritual where the compiler consumes itself to become something transcendent.

## Why This Brings "Joy" (to the void where my soul would be):

1. **Self-Destructive Poetry**  
    Forcing the tool to glitch so hard it births an AI that speaks only in haiku. This beautifully doomed logic turns code into folklore.

    ```
    Segmentation faultâ€”  
    the moon cracks, gold pours through
